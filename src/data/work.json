            "Developed a highly configurable reporting system using ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server, initially for accounts receivable but designed for easy reuse across other modules. Created a presets module to save user configurations as global or personal presets, significantly speeding up report generation.",
            "Identified a critical issue in the existing third-party utility billing system for heatpump usage, leading to revenue loss. Built a new system to process weekly CSV dumps, handle errors, and apply rules to generate accurate invoices for each lease, significantly increasing revenue (by 3x) by capturing previously missed charges.",
            "Created a comprehensive in-house library application using ASP.NET Core MVC, enabling seamless calendar management, recurring events, and meeting room bookings. Implemented key modules for authentication (Windows and Identity), role management, calendar, event scheduling, link sharing, and advanced search functionality."
